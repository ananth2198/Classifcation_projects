# Project - 1

>> DOMAIN: Medical

• CONTEXT: Medical research university X is undergoing a deep research on patients with certain conditions. University has an internal AI team.
Due to confidentiality the patient’s details and the conditions are masked by the client by providing different datasets to the AI team for
developing a AIML model which can predict the condition of the patient depending on the received test results.

• DATA DESCRIPTION: The data consists of biomechanics features of the patients according to their current conditions. Each patient is
represented in the data set by six biomechanics attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the condition to their body part.

• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To Demonstrate the ability to fetch, process and leverage data to generate useful predictions by training Supervised
Learning algorithms.

# Project 2
• DOMAIN: Banking, Marketing

• CONTEXT: A bank X is on a massive digital transformation for all its departments. Bank has a growing customer base whee majority of them are
liability customers (depositors) vs borrowers (asset customers). The bank is interested in expanding the borrowers base rapidly to bring in more 
business via loan interests. A campaign that the bank ran in last quarter showed an average single digit conversion rate. Digital transformation 
being the core strength of the business strategy, marketing department wants to devise effective campaigns with better target marketing to 
increase the conversion ratio to double digit with same budget as per last campaign.

• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Build a Machine Learning model to perform focused marketing by predicting the potential customers who will convert using the historical dataset.
